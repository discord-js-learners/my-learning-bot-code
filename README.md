# My learning bot Code

Note: 
if your using discord.js V13 make sure to create a file called .env
and write in

`TOKEN= your discord bot token!`

and to run the bot from vs code(visual studio code) just do the command

node index.js 

I have been learning is from the last 
2 weeks and itâ€™s going well!!

If there are any errors with the code
DM me on discord
