and if your using discord.js V13 make sure to create a file called .env
and write in

TOKEN= your discord bot token!

and to run the bot from vs code(visual studio code) just do the command

node index.js 

I have been learning is from the last 
2 weeks and itâ€™s going well!!

If there are any errors with the code
DM me on discord

praneethprogamer#0476

if your too lazy to put in the code then just download it from the
releases(will also be updated) this will be temporaray

i may take this down in the future
